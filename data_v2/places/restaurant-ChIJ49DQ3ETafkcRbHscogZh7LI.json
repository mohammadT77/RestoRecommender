Everything about the avocado toast would have been great - the avocado, the thinly sliced radishes, lightly wilted spinach, the fennel, the pumpkin seeds, a big slice of multigrain bread - all wonderful, and the first few bites were delicious. Then I got to the egg. It was raw. Both of our eggs were raw. The whites were not cooked, and the egg was cold, so the raw white part spilled all over the yummy veggies and made it really gross. We did our best to eat around it, but that was tough, considering it went everywhere.\n\nFood: 3 stars because it WOULD have been awesome had it not been for the egg issue.\n\n3. Service: We were the first people to arrive at noon for brunch. The hostess/waitress sat us and then got on her phone and quickly forgot about us. 10 minutes passed. I had to flag her down just to get some water. Again, we were the only people there. After the meal, when she came to take our plates, she didn't ask how it was (even though nearly half of the dish was left and both of us had an egg puddle on our plates), but I politely mentioned the problem anyway. It was merited. She rudely mansplained to me, as though I was a child, that the eggs were \"POACH-ED,\" gesticulating and over-enunciating that \"POACH-ED\" eggs have to be raw. I tried to tell her that was not correct, that there are different levels of poached, but none of them are RAW. Yes, the yolk should be runny, but the whites should be cooked. Or rather cook-ED.
