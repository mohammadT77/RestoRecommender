ChIJORN_mdnbfkcRq7g9fQtODbE,"Really gentle and humble people. On top, food‚Äôs quality is great. They are not just serving a regular Indian menu, they have items from different parts of India which makes them a unique place to try.",5,2024-03-17T14:46:18Z,2 months ago
ChIJORN_mdnbfkcRq7g9fQtODbE,"We booked a table for 10 people. We all enjoyed the meal, and found the Indian dishes to be delicious and authentic. Everything is made fresh when it's ordered, so it takes longer to arrive - something to be aware of, if you're in a rush. The staff were friendly and helpful, and they spoke English and Italian. I would definitely dine here again",5,2023-12-27T15:53:17Z,5 months ago
ChIJORN_mdnbfkcRq7g9fQtODbE,"Wonderful dinner with delicious dishes. Haven't had this good Indian food for a long time!

ChIJJ2V2p07bfkcRUn-PDbI80hI,"The best: cicchetti made in the moment. They have almost 10 different types of cicchetti, also polpette and mini panini. The tables outside are nice to chill. Perfect for groups. They have one unisex bathroom. The worst: paying before ordering so normally you make a line of 3 to 5 minutes. Also, the drinks don't come with absolutely nothing to eat, not even patatine.",4,2022-10-04T08:05:01Z,a year ago

ChIJJ2V2p07bfkcRUn-PDbI80hI,"I was sick, it was Sunday afternoon and ALL the bars in the area were closed. I really needed the toilet.
I approached the owner to beg to use it, and the only thing he cared was to keep the place clean, because the toilet was supposed to be for the customers.
The toilet had no paper, it was not clean and rushed me to leave.
I had to buy a coke of course, at least I was a customer too.

ChIJgxBB_LrbfkcR4vPJOeFgUw8,"Service 10/10 the waiter name is Antoine. Great service and great manners.
Food 9/10 The beef tartare (battuta cruda di manzo) was fabulous. They helped to divide the portion for me and my husband. The spaghettoni with sea urchin were great too. The Tuna had a nice spice twist to it. The dessert( pazientina padovana) was very nice however, based on my personal opinion, a little too much alcohol for it. Please do note that I don't drink that much and zabaione cream need to have alcohol inside but, for my personal taste as a closings plate, there was a little too much of it. But I repeat, is just my opinion coming from an Asian prospective. My Italian husband loved it.
Atmosphere 10/10 Great music and the happy atmosphere between the service made it awesome!

Please please please if you have the opportunity do visit this restaurant(opened in 1934). It is really worth a visit ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä.",5,2022-10-18T07:48:39Z,a year ago

ChIJgxBB_LrbfkcR4vPJOeFgUw8,"I booked a table for 13:30 , I was there punctual and they did not care about us ( with a small child ) . I got my table at 14:20 ( after 50 min delay ) . It was unacceptable that even they did not apologised about this uncomfortable situation. Waiting people for 50 minutes till 14:20 as you know they don‚Äôt have any chance to go to
Other place as it is late !!!!! Unprofessional.
In addition they bright us a sweet extra by mistake and put on my bill.
I payed 440 euro and they did not say even e thanks or sorry for this situation .
I think the story is like this : they accept late booking around 13:30 and they keep people waiting till 14/14:30 like this they are sure the get 2 round people .
I don‚Äôt talk about food . It was fine but there behave was unacceptable.

ChIJvyiVxUvbfkcRgRlKtiaeKcY,"WITHOUT ANY DOUBT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Finding myself in the area sleeping for work I wanted to eat ""a piece of meat"" for dinner.

I am welcomed by the very nice and friendly owners in this extremely nice place with a few seats, soft lights and pleasant music, a showcase with good bottles and a truly suggestive and inviting fireplace with embers.

I had dinner with a slice of beef cooked to perfection seasoned with parmesan rocket and balsamic vinegar and accompanied by a totally USELESS knife because that cut of meat was so tender. Delicious potatoes on the side and an excellent Montepulciano of which I won't deny having made an encore closed the meal. A very delicate tiramisu, which borders on food pornography and a kindly offered sip of Malvasia decorated everything with bows.

Summing up:
indisputable quality of the products used, impeccable service and beautiful surroundings.

The price is certainly balanced and adequate for the service offered in its entirety.

I never review a place except for real merits. Just forgive the low quality of the photos.
I will return without a shadow of a doubt for pleasure or otherwise. I highly recommend anyone reading this to do the same.",5,2023-11-21T20:50:26Z,6 months ago

ChIJC628jEXafkcRb38-THnIM0E,"We loved it. I've lived in Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona and cabo Mexico. So I grew up exposed to different styles of Mexican food. My husband thats Italian is new this type of food and lovvvvvveeeeeessssss it. So we were thrilled to try this restaurant. The female staff is beyond amazing and kind.
The drinks we loved so much we had 4. The food was delicious. Wonderful flavor in ever bite. üòã
Just wish the male waiter wasn't so rude to us when we arrived and sat down. Before I looked at the menu I asked him if they had a few dishes. He just quickly rudely said no and walked off. My husband was about to yell at him but I told him let it go. Luckily the food I asked about was on the menu. The guy was nicer after he saw that I was talking with the owner. But not about him. We talked about food and travel. So so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Honestly if I hadn't meet her, my review would have less stars because of the guy. But still same good review on the food and drinks. (He was also rude to other tables. I may not speak itlian yet but I understand it and venician. My husband speaks all dialects and a few other languages because of his job. Both of us have lived in Africa as well. And I've lived in China/ Beijing. So I listen to hear if locals are talking badly about me lol üòÜ or others. I mentioned this because we heard another table also upset by his behavior.
I know some behavior is the itlian way, but his wouldn't do well in other countries at all. I was a sous chef, restaurant manager at 3 restaurants and executive chef at a casino in the usa. Mostly fusion cuisine.
Each country is different of course. But the ones I've lived in except italy wouldn't allow his bad disposition)",5,2022-09-12T10:26:22Z,a year ago
ChIJC628jEXafkcRb38-THnIM0E,"The staff was really nice although our order took around 40 minutes to be served. As I have tried many authentic Mexican restaurants before, I must say that this one was not authentic. It was more Italian-Mexican, tailored to satisfy the italian tastebuds.

For this week (Feb 18th) they served a superb spaghetti with clams and also a nice pork with prosciutto crudo and baked mozzarella. It was really nice! If you're allergic, you can also ask them for gluten-free pasta. Just say it to them and they'll make it fresh for you. It is the only mensa which has beer and a LOT of beverage choices to accompany your meal. To make it even better, they also serve a real dessert instead of just the instant or pre-packaged ones.
However, I still give them 4 stars only because they don't have acqua naturale/mineral water and we need to go outside to get our dessert. Furthermore, we also need to sit down under shabby tents to enjoy it. Maybe it feels nice during spring or summer, but in winter... nah. And even though they apply strict health protocols inside, the way they arrange the seat outside clearly not for someone who has paranoia towards covid.

Then we had a chocolate mousse affair that was both intense and delicious. Our friends had gelato. All the deserts were made in house. This was a really excellent meal. The proprietor was delightful and good-natured and played along while we fumbled along in his language. Our friends preferred English which also worked fine. And, I had written ahead for a reservation telling him it was my wife‚Äôs birthday, so the mousse came out with a candle in it! A very nice touch! We had a wonderful time.

ChIJ7TjA-1fbfkcRBJTn2FE_v9E,"Great food and great staff!
The service is quick and efficient .
The taste is excellent and dishes are very well presented .

what I love the most about this place is the balance between the rice and the other ingredients ( right amount of rice, no sugar in the rice and the thickness of the fish slices).

A must try are the crystal dumpling .

Also the decorations and the ambience is curated.

Well done to the waiting team and to the kitchen team!

Update to the review after a year:

They changed their menu and now they have new dishes that are extremely tasty and delicious. They also improved the ordering system so that you can order through your phone .",5,2023-11-07T09:13:15Z,6 months ago

ChIJf3QTVOvFfkcRd3uwKLiZg7Y,"Two grills for two people each. Abundant and tasty. Pan at the table which, however, keeps the dish warm for too short a time. Delicious bread; not common for these areas.
Small, pleasant place, but with seats that are poorly protected from the cold outside. The entrance door does not screen properly. It freezes as soon as it opens. Poorly sized tables: small for 4 people, in contrast with rather large passage spaces. Retro/modern style furnishings and decorations. Restyling of what in the past was perhaps already a place open to the public. Bathrooms with some adjustments....to be reviewed. The external space is interesting: certainly pleasant to live in during the summer months. Free parking on the street. Easy access even for wheelchairs. Friendly staff who, however, prefer that you choose via QR code or, at worst, via paper menu. Much appreciated.

However when he shouted at me for trying to order a meal, in the wrong order, according to him,  (though he was directly asking me what I wanted) while saying to others ‚Äòshe doesn‚Äôt speak the language‚Äô, he went a step too far. I don‚Äôt speak Italian but I can manage to order in Italian and have been doing so for the last two years while visiting my son there. He tried to embarrass me on purpose and that‚Äôs just not acceptable. He then expected me to order food with him but I refused, so I can‚Äôt really comment on the food but the service was shocking.

The second time, we wanted to taste what we couldn't the first time, and we called and asked for some pizzas to bring home. First of all, they told us the pizzas will be in our house in one hour and a half. THAT IS SO MUCH TIME!! After two hours waiting, they called us saying the pizzas were on their way and we could wait for them downstairs. 15 minutes waiting downstairs, nobody came. We called several times, nobody answeres. Finally, we couldn't have dinner, no one came and nobody warned us about this. Horrible!!

Answering to you, I can not accept you insult my intelligence. We were waiting and calling you for more than two hours and you wouldn't be able to warned us that we werent going to have dinner.

We tried a few dishes but they filled us up abundantly.
The only discordant note, hence the 4 stars: as the environment was very small, every time new customers entered, the biting cold of the evening also entered. So we got quite a bit cold while we ate.
I would recommend a rotating heater to warm up the room at least a little in the presence of customers who are quite sensitive to the cold like us.

It's the type of restaurant you go for a gastronomical experience. We went and got the menu degustazione ""La Terra e La Collina"", which has a total of 5 dishes.

ChIJScQPg6_bfkcRCjD2IcCbQVI,"I enjoyed Radici, and applaud the kitchen‚Äôs innovation and creativity.  Unfortunately, not everything tasted good.  That is the point, no? Alinea in Chicago, which was one of the most heralded restaurants in the world, also one of the most expensive, sometimes forgot food is supposed to taste good.

Hushed and elegant, I was compelled to keep my voice down at Radici.  That‚Äôs hard after several vodkas.  Service matches the elegant decor, formal but pleasant, whisking plates away in almost a choreographed manner. We ordered the 7 course, 75 Euro, ILMARE E LA LAGUNA menu.  Radici offers several set menus including a blind degustation along with an a la carte menu.  There are so many combinations on offer, it became dizzying figuring it all out.  It was just easier to settle on one without deciphering the menu puzzle.

There were several aspects of Radici that stood out: Bread was taken seriously and the origin and ingredients of the two types of bread explained and described.  Bravo! and Brava!  More restaurants should do this.  I enjoyed the lightness of the cold Spaghettino with sour cream, caviar and oysters.  It was unique.  The highlight dish was the Sogliola, farro, spinacino e foie gras, a deconstructed thing with foie gras foam.  It was creative AND delicous.
The other dishes were either unmemorable, tasteless, or tasted bad.

Our final bill was a bit over 200 Euros with 3 cocktails and two glasses of wine.  High considering our dinner at the one Michelin star Iacobucci, an hour away, was less. If I lived in Padova I would visit Radici every few months, just to check in to see what the kitchen is up to.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

From the moment we stepped into Tola Rasa, we knew we were about to embark on a culinary journey like no other. The warmth of the place enveloped us, setting the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

As a vegetarian, I was absolutely thrilled with the dedicated 6-course vegetarian delight that was on offer. Each dish was a masterpiece, carefully crafted with a harmonious blend of fresh ingredients that tantalized the palate in a symphony of flavours and textures. It was evident that the chef has an innate talent to transform simple ingredients into gourmet delicacies that spoke to every sense.

The staff were the epitome of professionalism, balancing a friendly demeanor with impeccable service, making us feel both valued and comfortable throughout our dining experience. The personal touch in their service made our evening feel incredibly special.

But what truly set Tola Rasa apart was the atmosphere. Cosy yet refined, it provided the perfect backdrop for a culinary journey that felt both exclusive and welcoming, a place where gastronomy meets artistry in a ballet of flavours and emotions.

As we left, we couldn't help but feel a certain longing, a desire to return to this haven of culinary excellence nestled in the heart of Padova. Tola Rasa, you have our hearts and our utmost appreciation for a dining experience par excellence. We cannot wait to return and relive this delightful escapade. Until then, Tola Rasa remains a gem in Padova's crown, a place where every meal turns into a cherished memory.

We were ignored by all staff when we first arrived and already felt unwelcome. If they were not set up yet, that would have been OK. They could have served drinks and said so politely. The place was empty and we were clearly the first to arrive so they weren't busy with other customers. Who I presume to be the owner muttered something inaudibly and rudely besides us. I had to ask to repeat what he said as I'm not an Italian native but he rushed off before he gave us time to answer? We stood around unsure whether we were going to be seated or not but were still ignored. We ended up leaving. We made a half an hour bus journey out to this restaurant as I had been to this restaurant before and had had a good experience. Really disappointed with this service and will not be coming back. If you do not open at 7pm, please do not have the option for booking this time online or having it as your opening time on your website either as you clearly were not prepared.",1,2022-04-24T08:54:08Z,2 years ago

ChIJ7xdt31XafkcRzKEm8X7M6l8,"Nero di Seppia is a fantastic little restaurant located in Padua right where Ponte Corvo is (2 minutes from Saint Anthony's Cathedral).
At the helm is one of the most talented lady chefs I have ever had the pleasure of dining from.

The menu is simple and concise, yet every dish is a poetic symphony of flavors. The description, both in Italian and English truly showcase the creativity of the chef while constructing the plates.

We had four apetizers:

- Baccal√† Mantecato -
A dish made of cod blebded with milk and spices untill it acquires a buttery texture (Mantecatura). Very traditional in the Veneto region.

- Braised Octopus with white Beans -
Simple yet elegant. The octopus was tender and flavoful which combined with the white beans and a drizzle of fresh Olive Oil created a smooth silky finish in your palate.

- Zucchini Flowers filled with Ricotta and crispy Kale -
This is another traditional dish from the north of Italy (Fiori di Zucca). Great flavor, crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. All of it with accompanied by a smooth and velvety sauce with saffron.

- Porcini Mushrooms with White Polenta and Gorgonzola -
Fresh Porcini Mushrooms are a seasonal find, nornally in the fall when you have rains. I am lost in words on how to describe the flavors of this excellent combination. White Polenta is a staple of Veneto's cuisine and to see this great simple dish stand out so beutifully was a truebsensory pleasure.

We concluded our meal by trying two desserts:

- Mille Foglie on the spot with fresh forest Berries -
Delicious ! (Look at the photos)

- ""Sugoi"" of grapes
A grape pudding (although with more texture) it was marvelous! (Chek the photos)

I HIGHLY recomend you ask the waiter to select a dessert wine to pair with your meal, we did and it was perfect.

All in all we spent 100 euros and as you can tell both of us left extremely happy.

Thank you again to the establishment for such a serene and flavorful experience.",5,2023-10-12T18:29:46Z,7 months ago

ChIJtSDfulHafkcRXqCEUnZKrN0,"Great service. The waiters would give up their whole life just so you could order. For comparison in my country (Slovakia) let's say you are not sure what you would get in a restaurant and you ask them a question regarding the menu thats written on a sign in front of the restaurant. The response from the waiter would be something along the lines of ""I don't have time for this, we have it written on the sign *pointing at the sign*"" while here in Italy and especially in this restaurant they literally brought the sign to me so I could see the menu better. And it's not just that. They are very polite, understand English very well and also have menu's in like 5 languages. German, British, Espanol, and some others I don't quite recall.

The food was amazing! Great price for what you get. I would even say that it's one of the cheaper ones. But don't let that fool you. The food is truly mouth-watering.

We've been here two times, and both of the times, it was a pleasure experience. The staff even asked us if we were enjoying our trip and told us to enjoy Italy. Also, I forgot to mention that here you don't pay the standard price for the table, silverware, and glasses.

If you want a great taste, take LA SOLAR, in my opinion the best. The environment is clean and tidy, there is no table service, you order at the counter then they give you a device that turns on when you have to collect the tray: so the idea is functional.

1. Don't order their hot chocolate, you will regret it instantly
2. Don't order their onion rings
3. The inside area can be quite cold

And basically that's it. I visited Gasoline last night for an impromptu meetup and I don't really like my visit, really. I gave it 3 stars because of my companion, not even because of the bar. First of all, it was already intimidating when I saw people gathering in the outdoor area. Then I thought, maybe it was because the inside was full. But no, the inside area was quite empty. Of course, because it was cold, we decided to go inside but... I don't know if we made the right choice or not because the music is way too loud for normal people. My conversation became a bit unpleasant because the volume is too loud and we always had our ""huh?"" moment for not hearing anything.
Also, I don't really like the waiter just 'stole' my glass in the sense that she took my glass although I haven't finished my drink. That's very annoying for me. At least, instead of taking it directly, she can ask first.... Sure, there was only a little bit left, but can't they ask for permission first?

Fantastic pizza and delish home made puddings for 4, wine for 2, zero alcohol beers and a coffee for me and it came to less than 70 Euros.  Fantastic value.  Service was super friendly. The garden to the rear was just perfect - really a delightful setting.  Everyone else appeared to be local which was a great clue. Maybe 15-20 other diners on a Monday evening.

BEPE BIGOI is a high quality pasta fast-food where the product is produced right in the restaurant - from scratch. The chef actually prepares the pasta in front of the clients, protected by Glass; that way you can enjoy the whole process (craving for a delicious plate of pasta in the meanwhile). The restaurant is environmentally friendly, and they use compostable materials to pack the products.
The staff is lovely, and highly trained; for them, the customer service is a priority.
They also offer 20% DISCOUNT for University students, which allows them to eat delicious pasta even if you are on a budget.
You can dine in or take it away - you decide.

It was the second time I try indian food so I was familiar with all the spices and and strong flavours. The dishes were delicious, appealing and, something I appreciated were the traditional plates and cutlery. The personal was always available, they came in to check every now and then if the food is good and everything is going well.
I would give 4 stars for the lack of parking lot but it is a general problem in that zone, and what they lack in parking they make up in spices ;)",5,2022-09-04T10:17:29Z,a year ago

Once, on Valentine's day, we had booked a week in advance for 2 adults and a baby with a baby seat. When we reached there, they kept us waiting with our baby in our arms for 20 minutes to tell us later that they don't have a baby seat for us. üôÑ Can you imagine, we had to leave with our mouths open in just plain amusement at 9pm on Valentine's evening with a hungry baby. This can make you understand the level of their professionalism.

For almost a year I have been taking pizza from you for the quality of the product and the Neapolitan style pizzas but yesterday you gave me 3 inedible crusts, one even with a hole in the centre, look at the photos.

ChIJqwUJbQjbfkcRLsZuQqEjEW4,"I recently discovered ""Umby Pizza"", a takeaway pizzeria located under my house. I was immediately struck by the prices, which are very affordable, and the quality of the ingredients, which are always fresh. At the moment I have only tried two pizzas, a margherita and another of my own to test the place. The pasta is soft and fragrant, and the sauce is rich and tasty.
[Update] I managed to try the Neapolitan dough, on another visit, and I must say that if you think of a contemporary Neapolitan dough with high and honeycombed edges, this is not the case, it still remains a different dough from classic dough found in other pizzerias in Padua. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the service is quick and efficient.

I arrive there at 7.49pm and the girl at the register tells me that she has sent the pizzas to the home address (when I hadn't requested it). I go to the house, unfortunately the boy didn't have the pos. I go back to the pizzeria and I am even charged 1.50 euros for the delivery that I had not requested. Apart from the fact that the ‚Ç¨1 addition for 13 grains of corn seems like an exaggeration to me, anything is fine, it's fine that there is an increase in cereals, but almost 8 cents per grain here we are talking about pure 18 carat gold.

I couldn't find no kebab in all London, Paris, Brussels or in any other place I've visited so far. It's uniqueness is something that I love, the meat it's perfectly sliced up with the traditional long-knife and the sauces make the whole kebab just amazing.

You can tell anyone to meet you in Arcella and mention Fathi... they‚Äôll know exactly where to show up. The little joint is conveniently located on the busy Tiziano Aspetti, equidistant from two Tran stops.
Now let‚Äôs talk about the food they serve. The Kebab is alright, but I have never had a kebab from Fathi and not have a stomach ache the next morning... but then again, maybe it‚Äôs just my luck.
The variety of pizzas will blow your mind. The brick oven is doing its work. However, the taste isn‚Äôt as good as some other joints in the area (Murano Pizza is very good). But keep in mind that this is probably the cheapest Margherita you‚Äôll find in Arcella, or even Padova.
The guy running Fathi knows the area very well. This comes in handy when you want a home delivery and have to explain him where to come to.

ChIJgd7lGbzbfkcRRmCOYA4ahBI,"The takeaway pizzeria is a bit cold/aseptic, in line with modern furnishings, but conveys an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcleanliness, organization and efficiency. Very courteous staff. The pizza, tasted in 2 versions: with traditional dough and with the shovel (Roman-style dough). The first, which does not meet my preferences, is in line with the Paduan tradition: a very thin base with a slightly leavened edge, the small thickness means that the pizza cools in a few seconds and the mozzarella is stratified in a slab that separates from the cut dough (but it's a personal taste). The shovel version is much better, less spread and with a more compact consistency. The ingredients, the same as the traditional version, are enhanced, the tomato seems to have more flavor and the mozzarella remains ""spotted"", warmer and stringier",4,2024-01-03T08:12:26Z,5 months ago
ChIJgd7lGbzbfkcRRmCOYA4ahBI,"The pizza isn't bad, the dough is good but the real flaw is in the seasoning, very little, very little.

The broths are good, the condiments are fresh and BBQ dishes are also included. They also do karaoke, but they mostly have Chinese songs (oh well, that's fine).

They still seated us. I suggest ro make a reservation because this place is popular. I can see why. Very popular with the Italians. You can see Italians are more comfortable with this food than Chinese dishes.

I can't get over the amazing service. And the food is 95% authentic. I've been to most of the countries that are featured on the menue. My baby sitter of 5 years was from Afghanistan. So familiar with that food. My husband has been around the middle east and Africa for work. I've lived in parts of Africa too. Mainly Johannesburg and cape Town. My husband has seen more. Usually we go to bologna or Milan for other cultures food. So glad Padua has such variety.

ChIJ-f8PoVTFfkcRFaUC-4vdDRE,"We went in to eat, and one of the workers there was speaking the same language as us. However, she did not say anything regarding that. There was no AC, but we still decided to go in as we we‚Äôre hungry. In english, we said that it‚Äôs a bummer that the AC doesn‚Äôt work and the girl worker and I think her boss started smirking and talking something behind our back. This of course made us somewhat furious and we decided to leave. When we exited, the lady came out and, for the first time spoke our language, trying to say something, but it was too late. She could‚Äôve said something when she first saw us, but she just decided to comment with her boss. Later on, after around an hour, she saw us on the street, her being in her car and shouted slures to us.

The terrace is just in front of a rather trafficked streed, but the noise is not that bad. The price of pizzas and beverages is a bit above average, but pizza here is totally wirth it. The crust was high and soft, and the dough was well prepared and not heavy at all. For my taste, it was a bit too cheesy, and covered a bit the flavour of the tomato sauce.

ChIJoeVQfJ7bfkcRZROZ_CFOubU,"Nice and welcoming place, spaces a little small if there are a few people present, but so far I have always seen it empty or with 1-2 customers. I visited the caf√© for a quick snack to replace lunch (the place also offers ""tasty and quick lunch"" options). Excellent choice of sandwiches, toast, piadinas: I choose a piadina and a cappuccino. Punctual service, the piadina costs much more than any other bar, but the price was displayed and I was fine with tasting it, I don't use cutlery or use indoor services, the piadina and cappuccino are good. A surprise that for me was a lapse in style at the time of the bill: the increase for the cover charge, a generic total is shown on the receipt, I ask for information and they tell me that the difference is due to this. Personally it seemed to me that they could compare themselves with other managements and decide on a less aggressive economic approach, but this is my opinion. In the cafeteria the prices are more in line with the world. I hope that the suggestion can be a starting point for evaluation, the choice is yours!

They serve Asian food from a few different countriesü§© we ordered tom yum and pad thai. The food arrived in around 10 minutes (probably also because we are the first customers of the night) and they look good and appealing. The portion size was also pretty big and worth the price.

I loveee their pad thaiüòç it was good and tasty. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of their tom yum. It was just okay and not tasty enough for me. Tom yum is supposed to be sour and a bit spicy but I didn't find it sour and spicy at allüòì even after I added leftover lime from the pad thai, it still didn't help.

ChIJv0mh_OvafkcRUbLYYKnV7Kk,"I had such an amazing experience on their Sunday 10‚Ç¨ all you want ribs offer. Although I always order food home but one time I ordered ribs and loved so decided to go on a Sunday.
The service and staff was really good so I wanted to test their behavior when ordering to the point when they start losing. When I ordered my 4th ribs plate, they made me wait double the usual time with the ones before, and had to ask 3 waiters/waitresses until by luck the cashier employee over heard my complaint and she asked the waiter to give me double the ribs plate. Although I only needed one more but she made me put an extra star here. Good job but not everyone would be lucky.

My suggestion js if someone orders fries, put more so we get fuller.
And add fries with every plate it will make people full already when they eat it while waiting the next plat.. but you know better.

ChIJH48FyFHafkcRFLa0J4Wgvak,"Excellent kitchen!
On the day I visited there was some problem so the opening time was delayed at 13:30, which meant I need to wait for almost one hour, I did and all this time is worth the waiting.
They really have and know how to process seafoods:
The prawn/lobster (?) are really SWEET and full of umami flavour, the oyster is not fishy at all, it was just creamy and soft with a hint of saltiness.
The catch of day is a kind of white fish (cod?not sure): high quality, nice texture, beautiful smell, although I didn't like the sauce, just too heavy for the fish which already has a lot of fat under the skin.And the taro also had a scary texture...slimy and cranchy, just not my fav texsure of taro://
As dessert I had cooked green apple stuffed with cheese surrounded by mix of sugar nut crunches, also delightful üôÇ.
The service is also great, I traveled alone so I asked the waitress whether it's possible to just order some of the raw seafoods and she did it for me-- big thanks! So happy that I didn't miss the delicious sashimi! They are attentive and personalize the service for everyone and always make sure everything is fine.
Not the cheapest restaurant but the high food quality and wonderful taste will make you convinced:) My absolute highlight in Padua.

ChIJH48FyFHafkcRFLa0J4Wgvak,"A piece of my foodie soul is left in this place forever. Pasta is my favourite food and we had INSANELY delicious spaghetti with red shrimp, pistachio sauce and candied lemon. Champagne is our favourite drink and we went three evenings to Enotavola Pino to have an amazing experience of tasting different kinds of Italian sparkling wine - found so many interesting names. You guys are the best, offering hundreds wines by glass is something truly crazy :) We have a kid and she ordered pasta with broccoli (!!) sauce after she tasted mine. Said it was the best in her life (kid - broccoli - whaaat?)
Appetisers are in a high level too, service is extremely friendly and nice playlist just adds a bit more of a good mood to every visit.

We travel a lot, but I would certainly come to Padova one more time just for those spaghetti and another foodgasm. Thank you for creating such a warm, great place.",5,2023-01-23T22:24:05Z,a year ago

Also, when placing an order we asked for 1 plate of bigoli to be split between out 2 children, when we received 1 full portion of ragu and a separate plate we were told we would need to separate the bigoli ourselves. Which is not an issue for us we do it all the time but not in the middle of a restaurant. Then come to find out that they misunderstood us and thought we ordered 2 portions of bigoli. We had a good laugh at that especially when i happened again for dessert. And horrible coffee which was suprising.

Now instead of saying I want a hamburger I say I want a Story.

Wide choice of classic but also alternative and refined ingredients (such as the BBQ sauce imported from the USA or the honey mustard they make themselves)

Crispy bun, excellent quality of meat, always very succulent. Crispy bacon and very tasty tomatoes.

The story is incredible. Absolutely worth trying. I also recommend the Archaeology, with the chicken cutlet. You can choose to have it with one or two cutlets. They make them thin so you can feel the other ingredients too.

The selection of fried foods is also excellent, both the nuggets and the potato chips are delicious, extra crunchy and salted just right.

Always very fast and available. You can go and collect them on site or they will deliver them to your home.

The prices are also very good. If you want a sandwich without spending more than 10 euros you have a huge choice.

Advise! Don't call the site number because they will put you on hold, use the Google one.

Both came to our table and described each delightful plate. The bread is the best we've had. Started with tomato ice cream. Exploded with flavors I never experienced.  (Really) Next to that on the same plate, shrimp on greens with a sauce I can't explain. There are no words,  just imagine you never tasted shrimp before. And now you have. We sopped up the sauce that the shrimp were on with that fantastic bread.  The next plate made me swoon.  Lamb chops artfully plated with dollops of creme clouds and apricot sauce. Cooked to perfect medium rare. All along the way a 2016 Cappelli brunello di monalcino that fell in love in your mouth with that food! No joke. It truly was a match made in heaven and suggested by the owner. G-d bless him. Can you believe the desert was most delightful coffee mousse chocolate cookie ice cream delight?

ChIJ-yQnyhPbfkcRAHXgsEK60pc,"Simply delicious.
Brunch republic in Padova offers a wide range of food, spacing from pancakes to Burger and it does it with a touch of originality so difficult to find it in a restaurant.
The menu Is rich, and it's very easy to find plates that you're gonna love! As for the salmon dance brunch, for example: A plate composed of salmon, avocado, beetroot hummus, eggs, bread, dried tomatoes, and salad, which I recommend you to try.
Or the Vegan burger: a delicious alternative to the meat one.
The Hot lattes and the Juices are extremely delicious and taste balanced, and the descriptions sound so nice, that you want to try them all ( and they are worth it ).

And the restaurant has a plus: the incredible customer service.
Carlos, one of the waiters, is such a wonderful and funny person, who transmit positive energy and that created an amazing environment around him. The staff was in symbiosis between them, and that was reflected on the service;  it was extremely efficient and pleasant - definitely one of the best I ever got in Padova.
Why do I say that? It was the first time I saw the clients go away with a big smile and only after having said bye to Carlos and all the other amazing members of the staff.
When you have a good team, you have a good restaurant! (And a full one I'd say)

ChIJk6LMdwjbfkcRqTV3lF8bJ2c,"We arrived at the restaurant exactly at opening time and asked for a table for 2 regardless of the location. But, this lady at the entrance refused to accommodate us while the restaurant was totally empty from customers saying only "" NO "" without apologizing and showing reason.

I tried to tell her, that we are 2 people and that there is definitely a spare place for 2 and she repeated the same "" NO "" with no respect to a customer.

The restaurant should have kept a welcoming person with a smiley face to show respect to clients even if there is no place to accommodate them although there is nothing on the Google page of the restaurant that shows that a reservation is necessary.

I hope this attitude can be improved from the marketing side and employees training side for the highest customer satisfaction at all times.

ChIJVckvy1HafkcR456aWJcAvlI,"The best bar in Padova, especially when you want to try some local wine. Bartenders are very helpful and they know a lot about different kinds of wines - just ask them and you'll get a private lecture about wines. Highly recommend!!

Took a bottle of the best Cuv√©e Rosso of the region with me and will definitely come back for more wine tasting under supervision of the great staff.
Absolutely must go to when visiting Padova.
You also can enjoy your drink on the street if u like to. 10/10 would definitely recommend.

ChIJpThkkazbfkcR_ZAfff-TNO4,"Once I was here for lunch and once for dinner. You can sit in the evening on the terrace, for lunch it is closed. If you want to get a table in the terrace, you need to make a reservation,botherwise it might be allergy r booked out. The staff is very attentive and kind. They also speak English and have a English menu. There is no WiFi available. The restaurant has an air condition, which make your stay more pleasant. Once I had ravioli with shrimps and scallops, which was really tasty, had a creamy texture despite there were no milk products added. The salad is good and basic. The mixed vegetable plate was a proper portion with zucchini, eggplant, green chicory leaves and tomato. If you order the pasta e fragioli, be aware it is a bean soup with some shredded tagliolini inside. The price is acceptable and it looks like a clean restaurant. Just the air in the toilet is a bit stuffy. At least you do not need to walk steps as it is next to the bar on the ground level. Nice interior, it is bright, italian style.",4,2022-07-14T20:30:54Z,a year ago
ChIJpThkkazbfkcR_ZAfff-TNO4,"The place is simply lovely. The owner reserved us a beautifully adorned table on the terrace. The staff was good-mannered and very good at their job - they made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The food the restaurant served us was - of course -  up to the expectations and the plate presentation was in line with the restaurant level.
Terrazza Carducci is a small pearl in Padova and a surprising restaurant right behind Prato della Valle Square. The view from the terrace is not exactly clear of obstructions, but the overall sensation is pleasant. The cutlery and plates were properly clean and the gentleness of the table staff surprising ( They were never rude - opposite of a lot of restaurants in Padova.
We mainly ordered first plates, and I can tell you that of the 17 people sat at the table, not a single one complained about food, and their experience was as satisfying as mine. I strongly suggest to try out this place.",5,2023-05-06T16:42:03Z,a year ago

ChIJ49DQ3ETafkcRbHscogZh7LI,"Great atmosphere. Problems with food. Terrible service.

1. Atmosphere: It's adorable. It's close to where I live. It looks like they have great menu options - very American-inspired with the Airstream trailer, cacti decor, and Mexican dishes, and they even sell Pendleton goods. Fun! I've been in Italy for years now, and this isn't common, so I was excited to try it.

Atmosphere: 5 stars.

2. Food: Both my friend and I ordered avocado toast. Everything about the avocado toast would have been great - the avocado, the thinly sliced radishes, lightly wilted spinach, the fennel, the pumpkin seeds, a big slice of multigrain bread - all wonderful, and the first few bites were delicious. Then I got to the egg. It was raw. Both of our eggs were raw. The whites were not cooked, and the egg was cold, so the raw white part spilled all over the yummy veggies and made it really gross. We did our best to eat around it, but that was tough, considering it went everywhere.

Food: 3 stars because it WOULD have been awesome had it not been for the egg issue.

3. Service: We were the first people to arrive at noon for brunch. The hostess/waitress sat us and then got on her phone and quickly forgot about us. 10 minutes passed. I had to flag her down just to get some water. Again, we were the only people there. After the meal, when she came to take our plates, she didn't ask how it was (even though nearly half of the dish was left and both of us had an egg puddle on our plates), but I politely mentioned the problem anyway. It was merited. She rudely mansplained to me, as though I was a child, that the eggs were ""POACH-ED,"" gesticulating and over-enunciating that ""POACH-ED"" eggs have to be raw. I tried to tell her that was not correct, that there are different levels of poached, but none of them are RAW. Yes, the yolk should be runny, but the whites should be cooked. Or rather cook-ED. And excuse me, but have you ever heard of customer service?! Don't try to make people feel like idiots because you served them salmonella on toast. Rude is rude. Do better.

Service: 1 star.",3,2024-02-24T16:46:37Z,3 months ago

Ok, let's look past all that.  We placed our order and my plate came within about 7 minutes.  Great!  We waited for my husband's plate (we both ordered pasta dishes)  and we waited.  Twenty minutes went by and we called a waiter over, gesturing to the missing meal in front of my husband.  10 more minutes went by.  We decided I should eat mine... it was cold, bland and unappetizing, but I ate it.  After I finished, my husband's meal arrived, but the pasta was clearly under cooked.  The waiter agreed and back it went!  Almost 40 minutes into our dinner and my husband still had no food.  We ate the bread out of the paper bag on the table and drank our bottle of wine.  His food arrived, he ate some of it. Meh.  We stayed to finish our bottle then made haste to the exit.

ChIJLQGJJHbbfkcRPKdKXJCJ6MU,"I have tried a few chinese takeout in Padova but so far, Yami is my favorite in terms of taste and price. I have tried their cantonese rice, rice with shrimpsüç§, and kung pao chickenüçó their rice is the best I've tried in Padova. Both rice were good but I prefer cantonese rice than rice with shrimps.

For the cantonese rice, they gave generous amount of peas and prosciutto and the portion size was big (really worth it; I recommend it!üòç). For the kung pao chicken, it tasted just okay. I had higher expectation for the kung pao chicken since the rice was good, I hope they will improve.

They allow ordering first via whatsapp so you only need to pay and take away (no waiting). But even if you wait for the food, they have a nice waiting room and they work fast. Overall, it's really worth to try!",5,2023-02-04T22:02:20Z,a year ago

Wine was served warm, a 53‚Ç¨ Barolo bottle (had to ask to be chilled), but at least the sommelier she was smiling. Final killer, the bill. They are charging 5 euros to sit. Holy cow!!

I also like the fact that you can see the kitchen.

ChIJ--NFldPafkcRyloMacuXomc,"Ladri!  Thieves!  I entered for lunch.  Prices posted on every table.  Even though my visit was the Monday AFTER Easter, I presumed I would be asked to pay the (Giorno Festiva) Holiday Rate.  Instead, when I went to pay my bill these thieves added another ‚Ç¨10 to the bill.  They told me that it doesn't matter the price posted on every table, that they had a TV monitor someplace in the foyer with the trumped up price.  I tried to explain to the manager that EVERY TABLE had a price list, and NONE gave the double-cost price they charged.  He did nothing to make it right!

The food was mediocre at best.  A young 'cook' went around to many tables offering special slices of meat from a skewer, but never came to my table.  I had eaten at this place many times before while traveling, and only stopped this time because it was convenient to the highway exit.

Do not waste your time or money to go here.  They were rude and made no effort to resolve the discrepancy between the price posted on every table what they actually charge!",1,2018-04-02T13:08:00Z,6 years ago

ChIJSw_j1mrbfkcR2HKzIAwxtzQ,"We got bullied by the chef!

We got a falafel ball burnt outside and raw inside.
Burnt chicken with thai salad, which was seasoned awful.
We also got tasteless, Carbonnara, which is an achievement on its own,  to produce that dish with no taste.
We also got ostrich  steak  with a very sour sauce, which made the meat impossible to eat.
Not getting  a fork and a knife.
for 6 minutes also didn't help.

The kind kid who serviced our table offered to change the dish to rice with ham and chicken and mango chutney.
Ham was pieces of some industrial ham, and chutney was from a jar. chicken was small pieces, and we also had pickled cucumber in the dish, which was super weird.
Rice was also under coocked.

At that point, we asked for the check and paid the  most unjustified 76 euros of our lives, i kid you not.

On the exit, a very angry big chef waited for us to tell us off!  And claimed that his food was great and we don't know how to appreciate his food.   We told him that he was perfect and left, scared he might hit us.
The worst food experience of our lives, that's for sure!",1,2024-05-19T02:38:52Z,a week ago

Recommended:
Walnut pesto pasta with side of tuna tartare - (the pesto is incredible. The side of tartare is an interesting choice but adds a fresh element)

ChIJrRhcI6PbfkcR4X6o40Z3edw,"Ok let's say that despite the many negative reviews we decided to try it anyway.
Let's start with the NON-EXISTENT service because they don't even bring the order to the table (oh well it can fit) but there was practically not even a paper placemat on the table, no cutlery, plus a sticky table everywhere, it's not clear what. Only 4 types of burgers and there were not all the sandwiches as we saw in the online menu. Absolutely mediocre sandwich let's say that for ‚Ç¨13.50 I expected much more...an absolute disappointment

I tried Hamburger Ardente without finding it particularly tasty and spicy; perhaps a more refined combination of ingredients could enhance it much more.

He's a little loose with quantities (impossible to eat them all) but his frankness, professionalism and spontaneity are appreciable. In addition to the excellent service, the furnishing details of the restaurant were very impressive: from the various postcards surrounding the entrance, to the phallic-shaped ornaments, to the open kitchen outside the restaurant, to the splendid veranda which houses a ""convivial"" table.

Already from the box, the perfume promised very well; upon opening and tasting I had confirmation. Tasty ingredients on a soft and tasty base. Cooking ""correctly"" and not hastily, the ingredients were all well integrated into the base.

Some small ""black"" marks on the pizzas but without any consequences on the taste or consistency of the dough.

At the weekend, a la carte menu is in place, slightly more expensive but  in line with the expectations from a place like this.

This restaurant it's not a first class, but overall the quality was OK. Food was tasty, freshly prepared, in some cases a bit stingy. For instance, I had  the ""Baccal√† alla Vicentina"" whose portion ended up in two small pieces.

First of all, the taste does not sound like real McDonald's in Russia, the USA, Dubai, Turkey, and others. It's not that much Mac's taste.

Prices are fair as usual, I think it is the same everywhere so no challenge of prices can be seen here.

To be honest, I like the atmosphere, sadly the main location is not good as the station is always busy, chance of rubberies and more but since this is their policy, again no complaints.

Stuff is nice, the strange thing is if you order from machines inside, the chance you see your number on board is so low, and if you don't speak Italian! That is another challenge.

Drinks are normal, I didn't like its coffee because doesn't taste coffee.

Fries are good so I give it 5!
Burger sadly 2 start since they really have a strange taste.

Services and cleanings are good, tho in a rush hour didn't expect a clean table

Extremely friendly, friendly and expert staff.

The place is beautiful, well looked after and very welcoming.
The possibility of getting take-away food and being able to eat it there while enjoying a beer is wonderful.

The variety of beers is wide and surprising.
It goes without saying that the beers, as little as I know, are of excellent quality!

The place is nice and the food is good but I have to give a very negative rating, the place is not able to handle groups.

My experience was negative, because we booked for a group and the venue was unable to manage the needs of this group.

The prices are much higher than expected, and I am unable to handle a la carte orders for the group.

We are offered menus because the kitchen is not able to handle too many variations. I would like to point out that we were about fifteen people, and the only customers of the evening... If you are not able to manage the requests of a single table...

Moral of the story fixed menu of starter and first course for a final cost of around ‚Ç¨40 each... I would say a little too much..

Service is always beyond amazing.
Highly recommend.

We saw this place in a fb video. I took a screen shot so we could find it. This never showed on google when I looked up good Chinese restaurants and bao or dim sum restaurants.
This is now our favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è. I had some dishes I haven't had accurately in months. This place is perfect! If you don't like the food here, the problem is you not the restaurant because this place is perfect.
We loved the food. It was beyond amazing. Reminds of the food I had when living in Beijing and Hawaii. Service is wonderful. Everyone was so kind. And most speak English which helps. I can understand a few languages but I can be nervous having a conversation. But I can communicate when needed. Even though they were busy on a Tuesday. They gave each table perfect service. Our second black bao was forgotten in the order and we were charged for it. So we are considering that a tip to them instead of being upset about it. The restaurant was so busy. And they had 1 British customer causing a lot of trouble. I felt bad for his date and for the servers handling him. So why we were not upset over the kissing bao and tea. (Second order of tea was missing too, but we were not charged for it) mistakes happen.
Will still be going back often when we can. We live locally, but very busy traveling around Italy and the usa for work.

Luckily, we still arrived at our reservation time, and one of the guys working there sorted everything out.
I'm glad it worked out. Our food was amazing! Sorry I didn't get photos of the ramen. We were too excited to eat it.
The restaurant food wise deserves 5.0 star rating. Plus, the guys waiting on us and the amazing chefs.
Seriously, by far the best Asian restaurant in padova. The ramen is way better than ichiban. On top of that, it's operated by actual Japanese. Not Chinese pretending to be Japanese. Nothing against that, but you can taste the food quality difference big time.
We seriously can't wait to go back.

ChIJ28RtGjDFfkcRMj70U1Ckc-k,"My family and I recently visited this restaurant after a long journey to Padua. We were weary from our travels and decided to ask our hotel's reception for a recommendation. They pointed us to this establishment, and we ventured in with hopes of a pleasant meal.

Upon entering, we requested a physical menu, only to be told that the menu was exclusively available online. We proceeded to sit outside, choosing one of the tables, and began perusing the online menu on our devices. To our surprise, merely three minutes later, an employee with a visibly irritated expression approached us. She curtly informed us that we couldn't sit at a table unless we were ordering. Politely, we explained that we were in the process of making our selections from the online menu, intending to order shortly. Despite our explanation, her demeanor left us feeling unwelcome.

What puzzled us even more was the fact that all the tables outside were entirely vacant; there was no one else around. We weren't blocking any potential guests, and the decision to sit was made to ensure a thoughtful selection from their online menu.

Regrettably, we decided to leave the restaurant as her attitude spoke volumes. It was clear she didn't want us there, and her lack of professionalism was distressing. This incident was unlike anything I've encountered in my travels around the world. Having to explain the situation to my bewildered children was a challenge in itself.

We were left questioning why we were treated so poorly, especially when we were genuinely interested in dining there. The experience left me feeling humiliated and disheartened. It's disconcerting to encounter such behavior, particularly in a place that should be synonymous with hospitality.

In conclusion, our visit to this restaurant was marred by a distressing encounter that overshadowed any anticipation we had for a good meal. It's my hope that establishments like these recognize the impact their employees' behavior can have on their customers' overall experience.",1,2023-08-09T20:54:31Z,9 months ago

ChIJeaet1pLafkcRQK8Mo2uXVog,"Well if you're looking for a truly authentic, rustic Italian experience look no further. This is venetos history in a meal.
The absolute best gnocchi in the world, i do suggest to order them plain and try all of the sauces they are to die for. The boiled and roasted meats are the real highlight but don't think the menu is any less. The baccal√† is my favorite, better than any I've tried personally.

ChIJZTNbuEvbfkcRtgWGUEyWFXc,"Absolutely the worst dinner I have ever had. My husband and I booked a dinner with the show, upon arrival they brought us upstairs, place was packed and looked like a canteen. My husband requested us to be moved downstairs, even if we would miss the show.
The carriage was nicely decorated, we got menus and ordered. The waitress recommended the grilled meats, as those are their speciality. We got starters, they were fine, nothing to write home about. The mains however were inedible. I got the fillet of hare which was barely cooked, had no seasoning whatsoever and it stank so bad that I managed two bites and had to leave it. My husband who is not a picky eater also did not finish his main course, another barely cooked piece of meat, probably a roadkill or something. Potatoes were clearly reheated and peperonata was presented in a pool of oil. Wine was good but the food was horrible and also expensive considering the quality.

The sauce is rich and flavorful, complementing the generous toppings that are always fresh and abundant. I would recommend the pepperoni, I added mushrooms also to creat my own unique pizza.

ChIJB0aslk3afkcRm1mMmkvJQi0,"This restaurant did it right, until the end when they allowed a last minute table of 14 people at nearly 11pm to sit for dinner. At that point they were so focused on setting up the table and the guests who had arrived (when I left at 11:30pm only 3 were seated), that they forgot they had other diners in the restaurant. I think it was probably just an unfortunate night to dine there but serviece is key in my book and I don't intend to go back.

I ordered an espresso and by the time I received it, it was cold so I did not drink it. Other than that, the food was good. The portions are small though, so be prepared to order Multiple courses. The crab appetizer was okay ( I had to pick out shells when I ate it) because it was a little dry but the shrimp appetizer looked much better when I saw it come out for another table. The tuna tartare is a very small portion for a main course, but the other dishes looked a bit larger so if you're concerned about being hungry, try the branzino or something else.

Overall, the food was good, but as the service was not great, I won't be going back, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a try.",3,2023-10-28T11:54:51Z,7 months ago

Arriving at the location and observing the kitchen and the elaborate work of the chef and staff, I realized that they may not accept us with no prior reservation. The assumption was right, but the nice lady who seemed to be the owner or at least a main partner, made an exception and allowed us in providing information that we should wait more than usual. We were unlucky as some of our friends who we lost earlier went back online and we had to leave the place and our luck to join them before having food. Anyway this would be the first place I would visit the next time I go to Padova. I should mention though that the prices are higher than casual restaurants of the city but quite ok for what they seem to offer.

The big problem was the impossibility of enjoying the event, given that the Municipality probably did not carry out regular disinfestation of the area before the event, and the midges ü¶ü slipped into your clothes and literally devoured you alive.

ChIJkdy-9snFfkcR18QvPuqJmaE,"The folpo festival is finally back after two years of forced stop due to the pandemic, some innovations have been introduced regarding the exhibition areas. The common thread that runs through the entire event is the history of Noventa and its ancient Fair, equally linked to the traditions and flavors of the Padua mainland and the sea that bathes Venice. The symbol of this mix is ‚Äã‚Äãprecisely Folpo which will be the protagonist in traditional taverns and street food.
The Fair will have a lot to offer the thousands of expected visitors. Quality food, local wines and beers, but also products from all over Italy and all the typical delicacies of fairs, live music, DJ sets, rides and attractions for the little ones.
In front of Piazza Europa there are the Dancing Fountains which you can admire on Saturday, Sunday and Monday at 7pm and 9.30pm in spectacular choreographies of lights and colours. Tuesday, for the last day of the Fair, final show from 11pm lasting 40 minutes.",5,2022-10-24T07:41:35Z,a year ago
ChIJkdy-9snFfkcR18QvPuqJmaE,"The festival itself is OK.
It's not clear what happens with the parking lots: in one of the places designated on the site, they were giving tickets without any printed price and without any receipt where it is written that they will give the money to San Vincenzo De Paoli ODV, to whom I wrote to ask how do we donors know that our donation has arrived, but I have not received a response.
To be honest, I have a photo of the ticket that I would have liked to add, but Google rejects it because it considers it advertising.

The service was also relatively fast, and there was no time limit.
