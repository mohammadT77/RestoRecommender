with aromatics and crispy guanciale. Wow! The flavours were just incredible. The scallop mousse was a nice touch too. The team here is friendly and warm. I arrived alone after checking a few places on a cold Friday night and settled wit taking advantage of the serene ambiance of this authentically rustic interior after a hectic and very exhausting flight/day..well, I made the right choice! they made me feel at home with true local hospitality.\n\nNext, Entrecote steak with forest mushrooms and very soft finely grated truffle, mildly peppered. Another winner! Cooked perfectly as I had requested, medium without any runny blood. The quality of the meat was top and exquisitetely prepared.\n\nTiramisu was a cute little serving which was a perfect portion after I stuffed myself and it had just the right sweetness to it that I needed.\n\nMy pictures honestly don't do justice to the taste and presentation of the food.\nOverall, a very beautiful discovery on my first and last night in Padova.
