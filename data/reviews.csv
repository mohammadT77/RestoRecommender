So I grew up exposed to different styles of Mexican food. My husband thats Italian is new this type of food and lovvvvvveeeeeessssss it. So we were thrilled to try this restaurant. The female staff is beyond amazing and kind.
The drinks we loved so much we had 4. The food was delicious. Wonderful flavor in ever bite. üòã
Just wish the male waiter wasn't so rude to us when we arrived and sat down. Before I looked at the menu I asked him if they had a few dishes. He just quickly rudely said no and walked off. My husband was about to yell at him but I told him let it go. Luckily the food I asked about was on the menu. The guy was nicer after he saw that I was talking with the owner. But not about him. We talked about food and travel. So so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Honestly if I hadn't meet her, my review would have less stars because of the guy. But still same good review on the food and drinks. (He was also rude to other tables. I may not speak itlian yet but I understand it and venician. My husband speaks all dialects and a few other languages because of his job. Both of us have lived in Africa as well. And I've lived in China/ Beijing. So I listen to hear if locals are talking badly about me lol üòÜ or others. I mentioned this because we heard another table also upset by his behavior.
I know some behavior is the itlian way, but his wouldn't do well in other countries at all. I was a sous chef, restaurant manager at 3 restaurants and executive chef at a casino in the usa. Mostly fusion cuisine.
Each country is different of course. But the ones I've lived in except italy wouldn't allow his bad disposition)",5,2022-09-12T10:26:22Z,a year ago

We decided to go there and it did not disappoint. The meals were amazing and, despite my Indonesian origin, they invoked the sense of home for me. The rabbit sallad was great and there is something with their escalope with artichoke that gave me a sense of comfort. My husband also enjoyed his polenta pie and salad.

Unfortunately, we had to ask for the dessert because the waitress did not offer them to us. A slight annoyance but their tiramisu is a new experience for me. I did not expect to be served a big portion of refreshing tiramisu.

Unfortunately, not everything tasted good.  That is the point, no? Alinea in Chicago, which was one of the most heralded restaurants in the world, also one of the most expensive, sometimes forgot food is supposed to taste good.

Hushed and elegant, I was compelled to keep my voice down at Radici.  That‚Äôs hard after several vodkas.  Service matches the elegant decor, formal but pleasant, whisking plates away in almost a choreographed manner. We ordered the 7 course, 75 Euro, ILMARE E LA LAGUNA menu.  Radici offers several set menus including a blind degustation along with an a la carte menu.  There are so many combinations on offer, it became dizzying figuring it all out.  It was just easier to settle on one without deciphering the menu puzzle.

There were several aspects of Radici that stood out: Bread was taken seriously and the origin and ingredients of the two types of bread explained and described.  Bravo! and Brava!  More restaurants should do this.  I enjoyed the lightness of the cold Spaghettino with sour cream, caviar and oysters.  It was unique.  The highlight dish was the Sogliola, farro, spinacino e foie gras, a deconstructed thing with foie gras foam.  It was creative AND delicous.
The other dishes were either unmemorable, tasteless, or tasted bad.

Our final bill was a bit over 200 Euros with 3 cocktails and two glasses of wine.  High considering our dinner at the one Michelin star Iacobucci, an hour away, was less. If I lived in Padova I would visit Radici every few months, just to check in to see what the kitchen is up to.

Quality cicchetti with a refined and non-trivial choice of ingredients.
Affordable and above all correct prices compared to the quality of the offer.

If that wasn't enough, they have the best pizza I've tasted in years. Undoubted quality of the flours, wholemeal dough perfectly balanced in terms of crunchiness, thickness and flavour.

The place was empty and we were clearly the first to arrive so they weren't busy with other customers. Who I presume to be the owner muttered something inaudibly and rudely besides us.

For comparison in my country (Slovakia) let's say you are not sure what you would get in a restaurant and you ask them a question regarding the menu thats written on a sign in front of the restaurant. The response from the waiter would be something along the lines of ""I don't have time for this, we have it written on the sign *pointing at the sign*"" while here in Italy and especially in this restaurant they literally brought the sign to me so I could see the menu better. And it's not just that. They are very polite, understand English very well and also have menu's in like 5 languages. German, British, Espanol, and some others I don't quite recall.

The food was amazing! Great price for what you get. I would even say that it's one of the cheaper ones. But don't let that fool you. The food is truly mouth-watering.

We've been here two times, and both of the times, it was a pleasure experience. The staff even asked us if we were enjoying our trip and told us to enjoy Italy.

The night shift male receptionist is so impolite and unwillingly hand out one extra bag per person.

On the day I visited there was some problem so the opening time was delayed at 13:30, which meant I need to wait for almost one hour, I did and all this time is worth the waiting.
They really have and know how to process seafoods:
The prawn/lobster (?) are really SWEET and full of umami flavour, the oyster is not fishy at all, it was just creamy and soft with a hint of saltiness.
The catch of day is a kind of white fish (cod?not sure): high quality, nice texture, beautiful smell, although I didn't like the sauce, just too heavy for the fish which already has a lot of fat under the skin.And the taro also had a scary texture...slimy and cranchy, just not my fav texsure of taro://
As dessert I had cooked green apple stuffed with cheese surrounded by mix of sugar nut crunches, also delightful üôÇ.
The service is also great, I traveled alone so I asked the waitress whether it's possible to just order some of the raw seafoods and she did it for me-- big thanks! So happy that I didn't miss the delicious sashimi! They are attentive and personalize the service for everyone and always make sure everything is fine.
Not the cheapest restaurant but the high food quality and wonderful taste will make you convinced:) My absolute highlight in Padua.

For me, they're good but in my opinion the dough is a bit thicker than the usual Italian pizza.
However, I dislike its seating, especially the outdoor ones.

ChIJEZqaCS3afkcRgQCDseKHnBM,places/ChIJEZqaCS3afkcRgQCDseKHnBM/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5emNDVUdBEAE,"Sincerely shocked. I asked for information first by telephone and then in person about the gym and the various single, package or subscription entrances and I was given obviously incorrect information. This in itself wasn't even a big problem, the problem was the way the guys at reception handled it, truly disgraceful. Instead of calmly explaining the situation and trying to find a solution (to what was their mistake resulting from incorrect information given to me) they handled everything in a rude, rude and arrogant manner, making me look like the one in the wrong. Even when I tried to ask for further information on registration and the sports medical certificate I was answered in an extremely rude and hasty manner. The only positive thing was the two personal trainers I spoke to, extremely kind and helpful, the only reason why I still consider signing up. Overall, however, it is absolutely shameful to have such a hostile and rude attitude towards a customer, and it is embarrassing to talk about loyalty when these are absolutely not the ways to bring a possible customer to loyalty, rather you make him run away. It was truly a bad experience.

In response I would like to point out that:
1) I never claimed to have a training schedule before deciding to sign up, simply when I went to find out and spoke directly with the personal trainer I was told that the trial lesson was aimed at understanding the person's abilities to then make a test sheet that would be explained by appointment for the next lesson. No one ever specified that it was necessary to register first and indeed, according to information given to me by telephone and in person by the secretariat, I was told that the staff service was also included with the registration package (which was only denied to me today), so I assumed that as it was for the enrollment package there would be no problems doing it even with a single lesson. I would also add that there was every intention of signing up for the next time, it was a decision already practically made.
2) the main problem was the rudeness and arrogance with which the two boys from the secretariat presented themselves. It would have been enough to explain things in a calm and civil manner, rather than raising one's voice and behaving in this abrupt and grumpy way. They could have simply politely asked me to move the appointment with the staff to a date after registration and I would have done so without problems, but evidently they are not capable of relating to the public in a calm manner.

Brunch republic in Padova offers a wide range of food, spacing from pancakes to Burger and it does it with a touch of originality so difficult to find it in a restaurant.
The menu Is rich, and it's very easy to find plates that you're gonna love! As for the salmon dance brunch, for example: A plate composed of salmon, avocado, beetroot hummus, eggs, bread, dried tomatoes, and salad, which I recommend you to try.
Or the Vegan burger: a delicious alternative to the meat one.
The Hot lattes and the Juices are extremely delicious and taste balanced, and the descriptions sound so nice, that you want to try them all ( and they are worth it ).

And the restaurant has a plus: the incredible customer service.
Carlos, one of the waiters, is such a wonderful and funny person, who transmit positive energy and that created an amazing environment around him. The staff was in symbiosis between them, and that was reflected on the service;  it was extremely efficient and pleasant - definitely one of the best I ever got in Padova.
Why do I say that? It was the first time I saw the clients go away with a big smile and only after having said bye to Carlos and all the other amazing members of the staff.

But, the fire is still there. I lived in Italy for 6 years and I love the lifestyle and social life of the people. But, for the first time in my 6 year stay, I feel so bad in this bar.
My friend and I were enjoying the night in the city center, and around 22:00 we decided to go to the Q bar, it was our first time in this club.
As soon as we arrived a lot of people started to pile up and after a while me and my friend were the only people left outside, the body guard was so rude and disrespectful. Even if we were so polite and arrived earlier than the rest, he said there is no place for us because of the reason that I don't want to say, sadly. üò°

That was the time, that I understood why he became a bodyguard while I am working in one of the most respected companies.

Since I was unable to get in and see the service in the bar, I have no idea about that, but the guards don't deserve such jobs that require humble behavior.

I hope the Q bar owner could see this and take measures to fire them and change with the humble and welcoming people. Anyway, I will never come back again.

If you're international tourist or a foreigner, please don't go there, most probably you will endup disappointed before you inter inside the club. Sadly it's truth, you can read similar reviews here.

I tried to tell her, that we are 2 people and that there is definitely a spare place for 2 and she repeated the same "" NO "" with no respect to a customer.

The restaurant should have kept a welcoming person with a smiley face to show respect to clients even if there is no place to accommodate them although there is nothing on the Google page of the restaurant that shows that a reservation is necessary.

I hope this attitude can be improved from the marketing side and employees training side for the highest customer satisfaction at all times.

1. Don't order their hot chocolate, you will regret it instantly
2. Don't order their onion rings
3. The inside area can be quite cold

And basically that's it. I visited Gasoline last night for an impromptu meetup and I don't really like my visit, really. I gave it 3 stars because of my companion, not even because of the bar. First of all, it was already intimidating when I saw people gathering in the outdoor area. Then I thought, maybe it was because the inside was full. But no, the inside area was quite empty. Of course, because it was cold, we decided to go inside but... I don't know if we made the right choice or not because the music is way too loud for normal people. My conversation became a bit unpleasant because the volume is too loud and we always had our ""huh?"" moment for not hearing anything.
Also, I don't really like the waiter just 'stole' my glass in the sense that she took my glass although I haven't finished my drink. That's very annoying for me. At least, instead of taking it directly, she can ask first.... Sure, there was only a little bit left, but can't they ask for permission first?

But, the fire is still there. I lived in Italy for 6 years and I love the lifestyle and social life of the people. But, for the first time in my 6 year stay, I feel so bad in this bar.
My friend and I were enjoying the night in the city center, and around 22:00 we decided to go to the Q bar, it was our first time in this club.
As soon as we arrived a lot of people started to pile up and after a while me and my friend were the only people left outside, the body guard was so rude and disrespectful. Even if we were so polite and arrived earlier than the rest, he said there is no place for us because of the reason that I don't want to say, sadly. üò°

That was the time, that I understood why he became a bodyguard while I am working in one of the most respected companies.

Since I was unable to get in and see the service in the bar, I have no idea about that, but the guards don't deserve such jobs that require humble behavior.

I hope the Q bar owner could see this and take measures to fire them and change with the humble and welcoming people. Anyway, I will never come back again.

If you're international tourist or a foreigner, please don't go there, most probably you will endup disappointed before you inter inside the club. Sadly it's truth, you can read similar reviews here.

First of all, the taste does not sound like real McDonald's in Russia, the USA, Dubai, Turkey, and others. It's not that much Mac's taste.

Prices are fair as usual, I think it is the same everywhere so no challenge of prices can be seen here.

To be honest, I like the atmosphere, sadly the main location is not good as the station is always busy, chance of rubberies and more but since this is their policy, again no complaints.

Stuff is nice, the strange thing is if you order from machines inside, the chance you see your number on board is so low, and if you don't speak Italian! That is another challenge.

Drinks are normal, I didn't like its coffee because doesn't taste coffee.

Fries are good so I give it 5!
Burger sadly 2 start since they really have a strange taste.

Services and cleanings are good, tho in a rush hour didn't expect a clean table
And finally is about the overall view, reasonable but should try different MCs to find the best",4,2023-02-20T21:33:31Z,a year ago

We have wanted to try this place for a long time hearing mixed reviews we decided to go. There is nothing bad to say about this place (other than the sticky floors on the way to the bathroom), it is standard Italian food. Nothing to make you go wow, nothing to make you complain. We did notice that it was somewhere people seemed to refuel and leave or as one group stayed and talked even though they had long finished eating. The service is quick, but lacking in anything but utilitarian duty. If you want something that will keep you going, traditional to the area, but don't want to be wowed then eat here. We will eat here again but not in a hurry or when we have people for a fine dinner.",3,2024-04-05T10:47:21Z,a month ago

I have only had the pleasure and privilege of going there twice, to celebrate my anniversary, and they have been two of the best dinner I believe I will ever have. Starting with the sublime food selection, there is something there for everyone, the wine is perfect and it is all achieved in a very respectful amount of time. The staff are the most welcoming and understanding, and they always make sure we are comfortable and provide us with whatever we need. A fine gentlemen kept an attentive eye on our table and continued to bring us bread if we were running low, which was a lovely gesture. As for the decor, the environment of the restaurant is the impossible combination of the splendour of a high end restaurant and familiarity of your family home. The lighting is soft and welcoming, and the pictures take you for a trip around the history of Italy and cuisine.

Typical food but quite average. Poor presentation. I asked for a borchetta but i just got a sliced meat that i could buy for 3-4‚Ç¨ max at the supermarket. It was offered as just sliced piece of meat.

I‚Äôd the gnocchi and pork and it was really nice. Not too heavy at all which gnocchi can be.
Good service too.

Edit : I can only go by the choice the vegetarians with us had for their main course and it was limited with all 3 having to choose (but enjoying) a bean type soup.
