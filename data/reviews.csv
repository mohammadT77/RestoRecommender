Just wish the male waiter wasn't so rude to us when we arrived and sat down. Before I looked at the menu I asked him if they had a few dishes. He just quickly rudely said no and walked off. My husband was about to yell at him but I told him let it go. Luckily the food I asked about was on the menu. The guy was nicer after he saw that I was talking with the owner. But not about him. We talked about food and travel. So so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Honestly if I hadn't meet her, my review would have less stars because of the guy. But still same good review on the food and drinks. (He was also rude to other tables. I may not speak itlian yet but I understand it and venician. My husband speaks all dialects and a few other languages because of his job. Both of us have lived in Africa as well. And I've lived in China/ Beijing. So I listen to hear if locals are talking badly about me lol üòÜ or others. I mentioned this because we heard another table also upset by his behavior.
I know some behavior is the itlian way, but his wouldn't do well in other countries at all. I was a sous chef, restaurant manager at 3 restaurants and executive chef at a casino in the usa. Mostly fusion cuisine.
Each country is different of course. But the ones I've lived in except italy wouldn't allow his bad disposition)",5

Unfortunately, not everything tasted good.  That is the point, no? Alinea in Chicago, which was one of the most heralded restaurants in the world, also one of the most expensive, sometimes forgot food is supposed to taste good.

Hushed and elegant, I was compelled to keep my voice down at Radici.  That‚Äôs hard after several vodkas.  Service matches the elegant decor, formal but pleasant, whisking plates away in almost a choreographed manner. We ordered the 7 course, 75 Euro, ILMARE E LA LAGUNA menu.  Radici offers several set menus including a blind degustation along with an a la carte menu.  There are so many combinations on offer, it became dizzying figuring it all out.  It was just easier to settle on one without deciphering the menu puzzle.

There were several aspects of Radici that stood out: Bread was taken seriously and the origin and ingredients of the two types of bread explained and described.  Bravo! and Brava!  More restaurants should do this.  I enjoyed the lightness of the cold Spaghettino with sour cream, caviar and oysters.  It was unique.  The highlight dish was the Sogliola, farro, spinacino e foie gras, a deconstructed thing with foie gras foam.  It was creative AND delicous.
The other dishes were either unmemorable, tasteless, or tasted bad.

Our final bill was a bit over 200 Euros with 3 cocktails and two glasses of wine.  High considering our dinner at the one Michelin star Iacobucci, an hour away, was less. If I lived in Padova I would visit Radici every few months, just to check in to see what the kitchen is up to.  As a tourist, I would not make Radici a destination restaurant.",4

The place was empty and we were clearly the first to arrive so they weren't busy with other customers. Who I presume to be the owner muttered something inaudibly and rudely besides us. I had to ask to repeat what he said as I'm not an Italian native but he rushed off before he gave us time to answer? We stood around unsure whether we were going to be seated or not but were still ignored. We ended up leaving. We made a half an hour bus journey out to this restaurant as I had been to this restaurant before and had had a good experience. Really disappointed with this service and will not be coming back.

On the day I visited there was some problem so the opening time was delayed at 13:30, which meant I need to wait for almost one hour, I did and all this time is worth the waiting.
They really have and know how to process seafoods:
The prawn/lobster (?) are really SWEET and full of umami flavour, the oyster is not fishy at all, it was just creamy and soft with a hint of saltiness.
The catch of day is a kind of white fish (cod?not sure): high quality, nice texture, beautiful smell, although I didn't like the sauce, just too heavy for the fish which already has a lot of fat under the skin.And the taro also had a scary texture...slimy and cranchy, just not my fav texsure of taro://
As dessert I had cooked green apple stuffed with cheese surrounded by mix of sugar nut crunches, also delightful üôÇ.
The service is also great, I traveled alone so I asked the waitress whether it's possible to just order some of the raw seafoods and she did it for me-- big thanks! So happy that I didn't miss the delicious sashimi! They are attentive and personalize the service for everyone and always make sure everything is fine.
Not the cheapest restaurant but the high food quality and wonderful taste will make you convinced:) My absolute highlight in Padua.

Champagne is our favourite drink and we went three evenings to Enotavola Pino to have an amazing experience of tasting different kinds of Italian sparkling wine - found so many interesting names. You guys are the best, offering hundreds wines by glass is something truly crazy :) We have a kid and she ordered pasta with broccoli (!!) sauce after she tasted mine. Said it was the best in her life (kid - broccoli - whaaat?)
Appetisers are in a high level too, service is extremely friendly and nice playlist just adds a bit more of a good mood to every visit.

We travel a lot, but I would certainly come to Padova one more time just for those spaghetti and another foodgasm. Thank you for creating such a warm, great place.",5

The only positive thing was the two personal trainers I spoke to, extremely kind and helpful, the only reason why I still consider signing up. Overall, however, it is absolutely shameful to have such a hostile and rude attitude towards a customer, and it is embarrassing to talk about loyalty when these are absolutely not the ways to bring a possible customer to loyalty, rather you make him run away. It was truly a bad experience.

In response I would like to point out that:
1) I never claimed to have a training schedule before deciding to sign up, simply when I went to find out and spoke directly with the personal trainer I was told that the trial lesson was aimed at understanding the person's abilities to then make a test sheet that would be explained by appointment for the next lesson. No one ever specified that it was necessary to register first and indeed, according to information given to me by telephone and in person by the secretariat, I was told that the staff service was also included with the registration package (which was only denied to me today), so I assumed that as it was for the enrollment package there would be no problems doing it even with a single lesson. I would also add that there was every intention of signing up for the next time, it was a decision already practically made.
2) the main problem was the rudeness and arrogance with which the two boys from the secretariat presented themselves. It would have been enough to explain things in a calm and civil manner, rather than raising one's voice and behaving in this abrupt and grumpy way. They could have simply politely asked me to move the appointment with the staff to a date after registration and I would have done so without problems, but evidently they are not capable of relating to the public in a calm manner. I also reiterate that they did not try in the slightest to find a way to resolve the issue (I repeat, the above would have been enough) nor were they friendly in answering the questions I posed on the sports medical certificate issue (I wanted to understand how the one in the agreement worked, where you should go and if you should make an appointment), but rather, in addition to answering in an annoyed and not very exhaustive manner, they abruptly showed me the sheet of paper attached to the counter as if to say ""read it there and make do"", I'm sorry but it's not the right way to do, and I say this as a person who also works with the public. It has happened to me many times to see rude customers (this was not the case and in fact, I think I behaved very calmly and calmly), but to see employees serving the public who go on a rampage like this for no reason whatsoever.",1

Brunch republic in Padova offers a wide range of food, spacing from pancakes to Burger and it does it with a touch of originality so difficult to find it in a restaurant.
The menu Is rich, and it's very easy to find plates that you're gonna love! As for the salmon dance brunch, for example: A plate composed of salmon, avocado, beetroot hummus, eggs, bread, dried tomatoes, and salad, which I recommend you to try.
Or the Vegan burger: a delicious alternative to the meat one.
The Hot lattes and the Juices are extremely delicious and taste balanced, and the descriptions sound so nice, that you want to try them all ( and they are worth it ).

And the restaurant has a plus: the incredible customer service.
Carlos, one of the waiters, is such a wonderful and funny person, who transmit positive energy and that created an amazing environment around him. The staff was in symbiosis between them, and that was reflected on the service;  it was extremely efficient and pleasant - definitely one of the best I ever got in Padova.
Why do I say that? It was the first time I saw the clients go away with a big smile and only after having said bye to Carlos and all the other amazing members of the staff.
When you have a good team, you have a good restaurant! (And a full one I'd say)

But, the fire is still there. I lived in Italy for 6 years and I love the lifestyle and social life of the people. But, for the first time in my 6 year stay, I feel so bad in this bar.
My friend and I were enjoying the night in the city center, and around 22:00 we decided to go to the Q bar, it was our first time in this club.
As soon as we arrived a lot of people started to pile up and after a while me and my friend were the only people left outside, the body guard was so rude and disrespectful. Even if we were so polite and arrived earlier than the rest, he said there is no place for us because of the reason that I don't want to say, sadly. üò°

That was the time, that I understood why he became a bodyguard while I am working in one of the most respected companies.

Since I was unable to get in and see the service in the bar, I have no idea about that, but the guards don't deserve such jobs that require humble behavior.

I hope the Q bar owner could see this and take measures to fire them and change with the humble and welcoming people. Anyway, I will never come back again.

If you're international tourist or a foreigner, please don't go there, most probably you will endup disappointed before you inter inside the club. Sadly it's truth, you can read similar reviews here.

Firstly, when the tall waitress tells in 20 mins, the kitchen closes, so he almost kicks you out in the door. I understand but then set the kitchen 2 hours BEFORE closing. Once inside, zero help to order. Food came, and honestly,....very normal. Wine was served warm, a 53‚Ç¨ Barolo bottle (had to ask to be chilled), but at least the sommelier she was smiling. Final killer, the bill. They are charging 5 euros to sit. Holy cow!! Indeed, and of course, nothing to the waitresses. Never ever again, attitude and spirit is just wrong. Food again is very average.

I think their food is first quality, they offer traditional Veneto' s meal but re invented under a modern view.
They also offer burgers and pizza, and they have different options for vegetarians.

I also like the fact that you can see the kitchen.

1. Don't order their hot chocolate, you will regret it instantly
2. Don't order their onion rings
3. The inside area can be quite cold

And basically that's it. I visited Gasoline last night for an impromptu meetup and I don't really like my visit, really. I gave it 3 stars because of my companion, not even because of the bar. First of all, it was already intimidating when I saw people gathering in the outdoor area. Then I thought, maybe it was because the inside was full. But no, the inside area was quite empty. Of course, because it was cold, we decided to go inside but... I don't know if we made the right choice or not because the music is way too loud for normal people. My conversation became a bit unpleasant because the volume is too loud and we always had our ""huh?"" moment for not hearing anything.
Also, I don't really like the waiter just 'stole' my glass in the sense that she took my glass although I haven't finished my drink. That's very annoying for me. At least, instead of taking it directly, she can ask first.... Sure, there was only a little bit left, but can't they ask for permission first?

Alright, the beer is good though. That's what I can say. And the parking fee is free after 18:00.",3

As soon as we arrived a lot of people started to pile up and after a while me and my friend were the only people left outside, the body guard was so rude and disrespectful. Even if we were so polite and arrived earlier than the rest, he said there is no place for us because of the reason that I don't want to say, sadly. üò°

That was the time, that I understood why he became a bodyguard while I am working in one of the most respected companies.

Since I was unable to get in and see the service in the bar, I have no idea about that, but the guards don't deserve such jobs that require humble behavior.

I hope the Q bar owner could see this and take measures to fire them and change with the humble and welcoming people. Anyway, I will never come back again.

If you're international tourist or a foreigner, please don't go there, most probably you will endup disappointed before you inter inside the club. Sadly it's truth, you can read similar reviews here.

First of all, the taste does not sound like real McDonald's in Russia, the USA, Dubai, Turkey, and others. It's not that much Mac's taste.

Prices are fair as usual, I think it is the same everywhere so no challenge of prices can be seen here.

To be honest, I like the atmosphere, sadly the main location is not good as the station is always busy, chance of rubberies and more but since this is their policy, again no complaints.

Stuff is nice, the strange thing is if you order from machines inside, the chance you see your number on board is so low, and if you don't speak Italian! That is another challenge.

Drinks are normal, I didn't like its coffee because doesn't taste coffee.

Fries are good so I give it 5!
Burger sadly 2 start since they really have a strange taste.

Services and cleanings are good, tho in a rush hour didn't expect a clean table

We arrived around 2.15 which is near to closing time, was raining outside plus have customers inside . She could be more polite than this even if doesn‚Äôt want to accept us as a customer . The way she looked at her watch and us like get hell out of here it‚Äôs too late .
