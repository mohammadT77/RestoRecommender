            "    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone of text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral)\n",
            "    * **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifying key entities in text (e.g., people, places, organizations)\n",
            "    * **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical role of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective)\n",

            "    * **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another\n",
            "    * **Text Summarization:** Condensing large amounts of text into shorter summaries\n",
