            "    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone of text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral)\n",
            "    * **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifying key entities in text (e.g., people, places, organizations)\n",
            "    * **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical role of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective)\n",
            "* **Generating Language:** NLP systems can create natural-sounding text or speech, including:\n",
            "    * **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another\n",
            "    * **Text Summarization:** Condensing large amounts of text into shorter summaries\n",
            "    * **Chatbots:** Creating conversational agents that can interact with humans\n",
            "    * **Speech Synthesis:** Generating synthetic speech from text\n",

            "* **Machine Learning:** Training algorithms on large datasets of text and speech to learn patterns and relationships.\n",
            "* **Deep Learning:** Using artificial neural networks to model complex language structures and relationships.\n",
